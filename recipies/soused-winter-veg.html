    <h2>Soused Winter Veg</h2>
    <p>Cooking vegetables in a pickling liquor really accentuates the flavour as it seasons them throughout.
        It's a delicate balance between sweet, sour and salty that really brings a new life to these familiar winter ingredients. 
        You could use it for most roots or robust winter veg. Try it on one veg or a mixture like we have here.

        Salmoriglio is a punchy, herby dressing, but chimichurri or salsa verde would also work very well.

        This simple, colourful side dish would be perfect for a dinner party or family gathering.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>30g fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>15g dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, grated</li>
        <li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 tbsp warm water</li>
        <li>6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>50g caster sugar</li>
        <li>50g salt</li>
        <li>400ml white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1.5l water</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>10 peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>250g carrots, washed & cut in half lengthways</li>
        <li>250g parsnips, peeled & cut into quarters lengthways</li>
        <li>150g beetroots, thoroughly washed</li>
        <li>150g cauliflower florets</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing the salmoriglio: In a bowl, slowly whisk together the herbs, grated garlic, lemon juice and water. Drizzle in the oil, mixing as you go. Cover and leave out at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Next make your pickling liquor: Dissolve the sugar and salt in the vinegar and water over a low heat. Add the bay leaf, peppercorns and cumin seeds and mix.</li>
        <li>Place the whole beetroots in the cooking liquor and turn the heat up to a rolling boil. After 25mins, add the carrots and parsnips. After a further 6 minutes, add the cauliflower florets and cook for a further 5 mins or so. Note, the beetroot stain the other vegetables. If you want to avoid this, cook in separate pans.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, drain and run under cold water to stop the vegetables from over-cooking. Peel the beetroots and cut into quarters.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Dry the vegetables and lightly drizzle with olive oil. Grill the vegetables for roughly 3-4 minutes per side, make sure you allow them to develop deep char marks.</li>
        <li>Serve scattered on a plate with dollops of the salmoriglio over the top, or mix in a bowl to coat them then plate up.</li>
